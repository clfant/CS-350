# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  The Project was to create a thermostat that relied on varies interfaces to function. This thermostat used timers and interupts to function with ease and ensure the tempature was maintained.
# What did you do particularly well?
  I planned well for the implmentation of this project. I laid a lot of the functionality out before trying to code it so I knew what fit together.
# Where could you improve?
  I could improve on the implementation side. I planned well but the actual coding was a struggle a bit.
# What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
  I have a pretty well established support network and I have had a lot of success with it. I am not sure that I am adding anything this time.
# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
  Understanding the differnet interfaces is going to be useful moving forward. Having this knowledge will make me more well rounded and knowledgable.
# How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I follow best pratices. I made the code as modular as possible and used comments to ensure the code was easy to read and understand.
